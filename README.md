# Campus Navigator

**Campus Navigator** is a desktop-based application designed to help users find optimal paths within a campus environment. This application implements three core graph traversal algorithms: **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Greedy Best-First Search**. It serves both as an educational tool and a practical solution for navigating between campus buildings.

## 📌 Features

- Visual representation of campus buildings and paths
- Choose and visualize pathfinding using:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**
- Interactive UI for selecting start and destination nodes
- Real-time path display

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
   Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
   Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to the next level.

3. **Greedy Best-First Search**  
   Selects the path that appears to be the most promising by using a heuristic (e.g., Euclidean distance).

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **Matplotlib / NetworkX** *(optional)* for graph visualization
- Custom data structures for graph and queue/stack implementations
